# Epicupsdraw

Epicupsdraw Is a Drawing Tool, which is made by angualr version 6.0.8 and mxGraph. In the internet I can see that many of them asking question regarding How to implement mxGraph in angular.x. Here is the solution. Here I have not not using any npm packages, using only the pure mxgraph js files. Those you can find it in the src folder.

## How to start

Clone the directory, make sure you have installed the latest verison of node and angualr in globally. else update the version.
